# 👋 Hi, I'm @PatrickBeh (Pat)

## About Me
Full-Stack Developer with 3+ years of experience building dynamic, user-centric web solutions. I've evolved from working with WordPress, Elementor, and JetEngine at Yakk Digital (2.5 years), through freelancing (6 months), to my current role where I primarily work with Laravel and Flutter while adapting to diverse client needs across multiple technologies and frameworks.

## Technical Skills
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend**: PHP, Laravel, Java, SpringBoot
- **Mobile**: Flutter
- **CMS**: WordPress, Shopify
- **Tools**: Git, JetEngine, ACF, Postman
- **Languages**: 🇧🇷 Portuguese (Native), 🇦🇺 English (Fluent)

## Featured Projects
- **Ololo Safaris**: Developed a complex content relationship system using ACF, JetEngine and PHP to streamline client content management across multiple custom post types including accommodations, destinations, sample itineraries, experiences, activities, travel tips, travel photos, journal entries, and custom enquiries.
- **B4 The Fight**: Implemented a "Netflix for fights" platform integrating memberPress and JW Player to enable pay-per-view events and subscription-based access to fight archives.

## Currently
Working as a Full-Stack Developer at Aastera Technology since January 2025, primarily using Laravel and Flutter, while also adapting to client-specific technologies including Python for LLM applications, CodeIgniter, and other frameworks as needed. Additionally expanding my backend skills through Java/SpringBoot as I'm passionate about backend development.

## What I Bring to the Table
