- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PatrickBeh
- As a dedicated Web Developer with 2.5 years of hands-on experience, I specialize in crafting dynamic, user-centric websites using WordPress, PHP, JavaScript, and Shopify. My journey in web development has seen me transition from working with popular platforms like Elementor and JetEngine to more complex custom development with PHP and ACF. I've led the development of high-quality websites and landing pages, always with an eye for detail, thanks to my collaboration with meticulous designers.
- I thrive on challenges, consistently expanding my skills and knowledge through continuous learning and teaching others. Whether mentoring interns in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or diving deep into the latest web technologies, I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in web development.
- Currently, Iâ€™m seeking new opportunities where I can continue to grow. Iâ€™m excited to bring my technical expertise, creative problem-solving, and passion for web development to a forward-thinking team.
